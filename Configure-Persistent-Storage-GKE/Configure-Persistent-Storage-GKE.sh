# Create manifests for PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for Google Cloud persistent disks (dynamically created or existing)

# Mount Google Cloud persistent disk PVCs - PersistentVolumeClaims as volumes in Pods

# Use manifests to create StatefulSets

# Mount Google Cloud persistent disk PVCs as volumes in StatefulSets

# Verify the connection of Pods in StatefulSets to particular PVs as the Pods are stopped and restarted
